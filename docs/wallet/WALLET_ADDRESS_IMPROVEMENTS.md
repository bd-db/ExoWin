## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Address Generation Process**
1. User selects amount and cryptocurrency
2. Bot calls `create_deposit_payment(user_id, amount_usd, crypto_currency)`
3. NOWPayments API generates unique address and calculates crypto amount
4. Payment details stored in context for tracking
5. Address displayed with copy functionality

### **Key Functions**
```python
# Generate payment from NOWPayments API
payment = await create_deposit_payment(user_id, amount_usd, crypto_currency)

# Extract payment details
payment_id = payment.get("payment_id")
payment_address = payment.get("pay_address")  # Real address from NOWPayments
pay_amount = payment.get("pay_amount")        # Real amount from NOWPayments

# Store for tracking
context.user_data[f"payment_{payment_id}"] = {
    "user_id": user_id,
    "amount_usd": amount_usd,
    "crypto_currency": crypto_currency,
    "payment_address": payment_address,
    "pay_amount": pay_amount
}
```

### **Copy Functionality**
- **Address Copy**: Shows full address in code block with copy instructions
- **Amount Copy**: Shows exact amount with critical warnings
- **Mobile Optimized**: Tap-and-hold instructions for mobile users
- **Desktop Optimized**: Ctrl+C instructions for desktop users

### **Payment URIs**
```python
# Generate wallet app URIs
uri_schemes = {
    "BTC": f"bitcoin:{address}?amount={amount}",
    "ETH": f"ethereum:{address}?value={amount}",
    "LTC": f"litecoin:{address}?amount={amount}",
    # ... more cryptocurrencies
}
```

### **Explorer Integration**
```python
# Generate explorer URLs
explorer_url = f"https://blockchair.com/{network_info['explorer']}/address/{payment_address}"
```

## 🛡️ Security & Safety Features
